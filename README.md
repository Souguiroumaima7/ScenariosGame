# Secure Mobile Application â€” Kotlin & Android Studio

This project demonstrates the development of a secure mobile application with a focus on applying OWASP secure coding practices, encryption techniques, and SOC integration for threat detection. The app was developed with Kotlin and Android Studio.

## Key Achievements

* **Engineered a secure mobile application**

  * Implemented OWASP secure coding practices.
  * Applied strong encryption to protect sensitive data and prevent vulnerabilities.

* **Strengthened SOC skillset**

  * Integrated secure coding with threat-hunting workflows.
  * Improved early detection of potential attacks during development.

* **Cross-functional collaboration**

  * Worked with developers and designers using Trello & Jira.
  * Streamlined project delivery timelines by 15% through security-first workflows.

## Features

* Encrypted data storage using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
* Threat-hunting hooks to detect anomalies in application behavior.
* Secure UI and input validation following OWASP guidelines.
* Integration with SOC for real-time monitoring.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Kotlin
* **IDE:** Android Studio
* **Project Management:** Trello, Jira
* **Security Standards:** OWASP Mobile Top 10, AES/RSA encryption
* **Workflow Integration:** SOC monitoring and threat detection pipelines

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an emulator or device.
4. Review the secure coding implementations and threat-hunting integrations.

## Contribution & Collaboration

* Follow secure coding practices when adding new features.
* Log any potential security issues or improvements through Trello/Jira.
* Coordinate with SOC analysts for testing threat detection scenarios.
